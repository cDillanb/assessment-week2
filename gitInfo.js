/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

const gitHubDefintion = 'A network for programmers to share and collaborate their work using repositories.'
//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

//CODE HERE
const status = {
    description: 'shows information about the directory you are in, like which files are being tracked.',
    code: 'git status'
}
//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
const add = {
    description: 'adds all or a specific file to be tracked by git',
